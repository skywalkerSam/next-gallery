## Error Log Archive

1.  i have no clue about this, it happens unexpectedly. One minute it's working fine and another it's not anymore. **/gallery** is effected. *error.tsx* comes to the rescue but, no aid. and the funny part is that after some time, it just somehow magically works, the error's gone.) - wtf?
    ` ⨯ [Error: [object Object]] { digest: '2626315493' }`

Until next time.)
